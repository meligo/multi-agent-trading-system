# KAMA (Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average) Implementation

## 🎯 Why KAMA?

Traditional moving averages (SMA, EMA) **lag too much in trends** and **whipsaw in chop**.

**KAMA solves this** by adapting to market efficiency:
- **Fast** when market is trending (high directional movement)
- **Slow** when market is choppy (low directional movement)

### Performance vs Traditional MA:
- **20-30% fewer false signals** in volatile regimes
- **Higher Sharpe ratios** (better risk-adjusted returns)
- **Lower drawdowns** (capital protection)

**Reference:** "The KAMA Advantage" by Nayab Bhutta

## 📐 KAMA Formula

### 1. Efficiency Ratio (ER)
Measures how directional the price movement is:

```
ER = |Change| / Volatility

Where:
- Change = abs(Close(n) - Close(0))
- Volatility = sum(abs(Close(i) - Close(i-1))) over n periods
```

**High ER** = Strong trend → KAMA reacts fast
**Low ER** = Choppy market → KAMA slows down

### 2. Smoothing Constant (SC)
Adapts between fast and slow based on ER:

```
Fast = 2/(fastest + 1)  # Default: 2/(2+1) = 0.6667
Slow = 2/(slowest + 1)  # Default: 2/(30+1) = 0.0645

SC = [ER × (Fast - Slow) + Slow]²
```

### 3. KAMA Calculation
Iterative calculation:

```
KAMA(i) = KAMA(i-1) + SC(i) × (Price(i) - KAMA(i-1))
```

**Result:** KAMA adapts its smoothing based on market conditions!

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Files Modified:

**`forex_data.py`:**

1. **Added `add_kama()` method** (lines 723-798)
   - Calculates KAMA with efficiency ratio
   - Computes additional signals:
     - `kama_slope`: 5-period slope (trend strength)
     - `kama_distance`: Price distance from KAMA (%)
     - `kama_vs_ma`: KAMA vs MA-20 (efficiency filter)

2. **Integrated into analysis pipeline** (lines 1236-1238)
   ```python
   df_primary = self.ta.add_kama(df_primary, n=10, fastest=2, slowest=30)
   df_secondary = self.ta.add_kama(df_secondary, n=10, fastest=2, slowest=30)
   ```

3. **Added to indicator extraction** (lines 1351-1355)
   ```python
   'kama': float(df_primary['kama'].iloc[-1]),
   'kama_slope': float(df_primary['kama_slope'].iloc[-1]),
   'kama_distance': float(df_primary['kama_distance'].iloc[-1]),
   'kama_vs_ma': float(df_primary['kama_vs_ma'].iloc[-1]),
   ```

### Files Created:

**`test_kama_indicator.py`:**
- Comprehensive test suite
- Signal interpretation
- Comparison with traditional MA
- Ready to run: `python test_kama_indicator.py`

## 📊 KAMA Indicators Provided

| Indicator | Description | Trading Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **kama** | Main KAMA value | Price vs KAMA (trend direction) |
| **kama_slope** | 5-period slope | Trend strength and acceleration |
| **kama_distance** | Price distance from KAMA (%) | Overbought/oversold |
| **kama_vs_ma** | KAMA vs MA-20 | Market efficiency filter |

## 💡 How to Use KAMA

### 1. Trend Direction
```python
if current_price > kama:
    # Bullish - price above adaptive MA
    signal = "BUY"
else:
    # Bearish - price below adaptive MA
    signal = "SELL"
```

### 2. Trend Strength
```python
if kama_slope > 0.0001:
    # Strong uptrend - KAMA rising fast
    strength = "HIGH"
elif kama_slope < -0.0001:
    # Strong downtrend - KAMA falling fast
    strength = "HIGH"
else:
    # Choppy/sideways - KAMA flat
    strength = "LOW"
```

### 3. Market Efficiency Filter
```python
if kama_vs_ma > 0:
    # KAMA > MA-20 = High efficiency (trending)
    # Safe to follow trend signals
    efficiency = "HIGH"
else:
    # KAMA < MA-20 = Low efficiency (choppy)
    # Use caution - potential whipsaws
    efficiency = "LOW"
```

### 4. Overbought/Oversold
```python
if kama_distance > 2.0:
    # Price >2% above KAMA
    condition = "OVERBOUGHT"
elif kama_distance < -2.0:
    # Price >2% below KAMA
    condition = "OVERSOLD"
else:
    condition = "NEUTRAL"
```

## 🎯 Trading Strategy Example

### Trend Following with KAMA:

```python
# Bullish Entry
if (price > kama and              # Price above KAMA
    kama_slope > 0 and            # KAMA rising
    kama_vs_ma > 0 and            # High efficiency
    kama_distance < 1.5):         # Not overextended

    signal = "BUY"
    confidence = 85

# Bearish Entry
elif (price < kama and            # Price below KAMA
      kama_slope < 0 and          # KAMA falling
      kama_vs_ma > 0 and          # High efficiency
      kama_distance > -1.5):      # Not overextended

    signal = "SELL"
    confidence = 85

# Hold/Wait
else:
    signal = "HOLD"
    # Market is choppy or signals are mixed
```
