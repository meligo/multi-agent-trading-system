# ‚úÖ CFD EPICs Fixed!

## Problem

Your IG demo account is a **CFD account**, but the system was using **DFB spread betting EPICs**.

### Error Message
```
HTTP error: 403 {"errorCode":"unauthorised access, apiUser has no access to the relevant exchange.
Epic=CS.D.EURUSD.TODAY.IP exchangeId=FX_BET_ALL"}
```

## Root Cause

- **Wrong EPIC format**: `CS.D.EURUSD.TODAY.IP` (DFB spread betting)
- **Correct EPIC format**: `CS.D.EURUSD.CFD.IP` (CFD trading)

IG Markets has two types of forex markets:
1. **DFB (Daily Funded Bet)** - Spread betting markets (.TODAY.IP suffix)
   - Requires spread betting account
   - Tax-free in UK
   - Your account doesn't have access to these

2. **CFD (Contract for Difference)** - CFD trading markets (.CFD.IP suffix)
   - Requires CFD account (which you have!)
   - Standard trading taxation
   - ‚úÖ Your account has access to these

## What Was Fixed

Updated `forex_config.py` (lines 77-108) with correct CFD EPICs:

### Before (WRONG):
```python
IG_EPIC_MAP = {
    "EUR_USD": "CS.D.EURUSD.TODAY.IP",  # ‚ùå DFB market
    "GBP_USD": "CS.D.GBPUSD.TODAY.IP",  # ‚ùå DFB market
    ...
}
```

### After (CORRECT):
```python
IG_EPIC_MAP = {
    "EUR_USD": "CS.D.EURUSD.CFD.IP",  # ‚úÖ CFD market
    "GBP_USD": "CS.D.GBPUSD.CFD.IP",  # ‚úÖ CFD market
    ...
}
```

All 28 forex pairs have been updated to use `.CFD.IP` suffix.

## How to Test

1. **Stop the current dashboard** (Ctrl+C in terminal)

2. **Restart the dashboard:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run ig_trading_dashboard.py
   ```

3. **Start in signals-only mode first:**
   - ‚úÖ UNCHECK "Enable Auto-Trading" checkbox
   - Click "‚ñ∂Ô∏è START SYSTEM"
   - Wait for first analysis cycle to complete
   - Check for errors in terminal

4. **Verify signal generation:**
   - Watch terminal output for: "‚úÖ SELL signal (confidence: 0.75)"
   - Should NOT see: "‚ùå unauthorised access" errors
   - Signals should save to database successfully

5. **If signals work, enable auto-trading (optional):**
   - Check "üî¥ Enable Auto-Trading" checkbox
   - Restart the system
   - Watch for: "‚úÖ REAL TRADE EXECUTED: EUR_USD SELL 0.10 lots"
   - Check "Open Positions" tab in dashboard

## Expected Output (Success)

```bash
üîç Analyzing EUR_USD...
   ‚úÖ SELL signal (confidence: 0.75)
‚úÖ REAL TRADE EXECUTED: EUR_USD SELL 0.10 lots
   Deal reference: DL123456789
   üìä Rate: 18/25 remaining

üîç Analyzing GBP_USD...
   ‚úÖ BUY signal (confidence: 0.80)
‚úÖ REAL TRADE EXECUTED: GBP_USD BUY 0.08 lots
   Deal reference: DL123456790
   üìä Rate: 12/25 remaining
```

## Complete Fix History

1. ‚úÖ **Database field errors** - Fixed all required fields for signals
2. ‚úÖ **Trade execution parameters** - Fixed positional arguments for IG API
3. ‚úÖ **CFD EPICs** - Changed from .TODAY.IP to .CFD.IP

## System Status

- ‚úÖ Authentication working (meligokes connected)
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting implemented (30 req/min account limit)
- ‚úÖ Database saving signals correctly
- ‚úÖ Position sizing calculated (1% risk per trade)
- ‚úÖ Stop loss/take profit conversion to points
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Correct CFD EPICs configured
- ‚è≥ **Testing needed**: Real trade execution with CFD markets

## Next Steps

1. **Restart dashboard** with fixed EPICs
2. **Test in signals-only mode** first (safe)
3. **Verify trades execute** if auto-trading enabled
4. **Monitor open positions** in dashboard
5. **Check P&L** in IG platform to confirm trades are real
