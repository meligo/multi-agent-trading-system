# ‚úÖ Expanded Pairs + Currency Exposure Filtering

## What Was Added

Two major risk management improvements:

1. **Expanded Trading Universe**: 7 ‚Üí 22 tradeable pairs
2. **Currency Exposure Filtering**: Only one position per currency at a time

## 1. Expanded Trading Universe

### Before
```python
PRIORITY_PAIRS = [
    "EUR_USD", "GBP_USD", "USD_JPY", "EUR_GBP", "AUD_USD",  # 5 forex
    "OIL_CRUDE", "OIL_BRENT",  # 2 commodities
]
# Total: 7 pairs
```

### After ‚úÖ
```python
PRIORITY_PAIRS = [
    # Major Pairs (7)
    "EUR_USD", "GBP_USD", "USD_JPY", "USD_CHF",
    "AUD_USD", "USD_CAD", "NZD_USD",

    # EUR Crosses (6)
    "EUR_GBP", "EUR_JPY", "EUR_AUD",
    "EUR_CAD", "EUR_CHF", "EUR_NZD",

    # GBP Crosses (4)
    "GBP_JPY", "GBP_AUD", "GBP_CAD", "GBP_CHF",

    # Other Crosses (3)
    "AUD_JPY", "AUD_CAD", "CAD_JPY",

    # Commodities (2)
    "OIL_CRUDE", "OIL_BRENT",
]
# Total: 22 pairs (3x more opportunities!)
```

### Why These Pairs?

Selected based on:
- **Liquidity**: Tight spreads, high volume
- **Technical Analysis**: AI indicators work well
- **Trading Hours**: Cover all sessions (Asia/Europe/US)
- **Correlation**: Diverse, not all moving together

## 2. Currency Exposure Filtering

### The Problem
**Without filtering:**
```
Analysis cycle generates:
1. EUR_USD BUY (confidence: 0.75)
2. EUR_GBP SELL (confidence: 0.80)
3. EUR_JPY BUY (confidence: 0.70)

System opens ALL 3 trades:
- 3 positions with EUR exposure
- If EUR moves against you ‚Üí 3 losing trades simultaneously
- Overexposure to single currency = HIGH RISK ‚ùå
```

### The Solution ‚úÖ
**With filtering:**
```
Analysis cycle generates:
1. EUR_USD BUY (confidence: 0.75)  ‚Üê EUR + USD
2. EUR_GBP SELL (confidence: 0.80) ‚Üê EUR + GBP (higher confidence)
3. EUR_JPY BUY (confidence: 0.70)  ‚Üê EUR + JPY

Currency Exposure Filter:
- EUR appears in all 3 signals
- Keep HIGHEST confidence: EUR_GBP SELL (0.80)
- Filter out: EUR_USD, EUR_JPY

System opens ONLY 1 trade:
- EUR_GBP SELL (0.80) ‚úÖ
- No duplicate EUR exposure
- Risk controlled ‚úÖ
```

### How It Works

**Step 1: Analyze All Pairs**
```
üîç Analyzing EUR_USD... ‚úÖ BUY (0.75)
üîç Analyzing GBP_USD... ‚úÖ SELL (0.68)
üîç Analyzing USD_JPY... ‚úÖ BUY (0.82)
üîç Analyzing EUR_GBP... ‚úÖ SELL (0.80)
üîç Analyzing EUR_JPY... ‚úÖ BUY (0.70)
...

Total signals: 8
```

**Step 2: Filter by Currency Exposure**
```
üìä SIGNAL FILTERING (Prevent Duplicate Currency Exposure)
Total signals generated: 8

Currency Analysis:
- EUR: Found in EUR_USD (0.75), EUR_GBP (0.80), EUR_JPY (0.70)
  ‚Üí Keep: EUR_GBP (0.80) ‚úÖ Highest confidence

- USD: Found in EUR_USD (0.75), GBP_USD (0.68), USD_JPY (0.82)
  ‚Üí Keep: USD_JPY (0.82) ‚úÖ Highest confidence

- GBP: Found in GBP_USD (0.68), EUR_GBP (0.80)
  ‚Üí Keep: EUR_GBP (0.80) ‚úÖ Highest confidence

- JPY: Found in USD_JPY (0.82), EUR_JPY (0.70)
  ‚Üí Keep: USD_JPY (0.82) ‚úÖ Highest confidence

Signals after filtering: 2
‚ö†Ô∏è  Filtered out 6 signals to prevent duplicate currency exposure

‚úÖ Selected signals (highest confidence per currency):
   EUR_GBP: SELL (confidence: 0.80) - EUR/GBP
   USD_JPY: BUY (confidence: 0.82) - USD/JPY
```

**Step 3: Execute Filtered Signals**
```
üîÑ Executing 2 filtered signals...
üìä Position check: 0/20 open (20 slots available)
‚úÖ REAL TRADE EXECUTED: EUR_GBP SELL 0.1 lots
üìä Position check: 1/20 open (19 slots available)
‚úÖ REAL TRADE EXECUTED: USD_JPY BUY 0.2 lots
```

```

## Dashboard Output Example

### Before (Old System)
```
‚úÖ Analysis cycle complete
   Pairs analyzed: 7
   Signals generated: 5
   Signals executed: 5  ‚Üê Executes ALL signals immediately
   Open positions: 5
```

**Risk**: Multiple EUR positions opened simultaneously

### After (New System) ‚úÖ
```
üìä SIGNAL FILTERING (Prevent Duplicate Currency Exposure)
Total signals generated: 12
Signals after filtering: 6
‚ö†Ô∏è  Filtered out 6 signals to prevent duplicate currency exposure

‚úÖ Selected signals (highest confidence per currency):
   EUR_GBP: SELL (0.80) - EUR/GBP
   USD_JPY: BUY (0.82) - USD/JPY
   AUD_CAD: BUY (0.78) - AUD/CAD
   GBP_CHF: SELL (0.76) - GBP/CHF
   OIL_CRUDE: SELL (0.74) - Commodity
   OIL_BRENT: BUY (0.71) - Commodity

üîÑ Executing 6 filtered signals...

‚úÖ Analysis cycle complete
   Pairs analyzed: 22  ‚Üê 3x more pairs
   Signals generated: 12
   Signals executed: 6  ‚Üê Only best signals
   Signals filtered: 6 (duplicate currency exposure)
   Open positions: 6
```

**Result**: Diverse exposure across currencies, controlled risk

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Filtering

In `ig_concurrent_worker.py`, the filtering happens automatically in `run_analysis_cycle()`.

To disable (not recommended):
```python
# Comment out the filtering step
# filtered_signals = self.filter_signals_by_currency_exposure(all_signals)

# Use all signals instead
filtered_signals = all_signals
```

### Adjust Number of Pairs

In `forex_config.py`:
```python
# Add or remove pairs from PRIORITY_PAIRS
PRIORITY_PAIRS = [
    # Add your favorite pairs here
    "EUR_USD",
    "GBP_USD",
    # ... up to any number you want
]
```

### Currency Conflict Rules

Commodities are treated separately:
```python
# These WON'T conflict with forex pairs
"OIL_CRUDE"   # Can trade alongside any forex pair
"OIL_BRENT"   # Can trade alongside any forex pair
"XAU_USD"     # Can trade alongside any forex pair (if available)
```

## Risk Management Layers

The system now has **5 layers** of protection:

### Layer 1: Position Size
- 1% risk per trade
- Max 10 lots MINI per position

### Layer 2: Stop Loss/Take Profit
- Every trade has SL and TP
- Minimum 1.5:1 risk/reward

### Layer 3: Position Count
- Maximum 20 concurrent positions
- Pre-trade check
- Startup discovery

### Layer 4: Currency Exposure (NEW!)
- Only one position per currency
- Highest confidence signal wins
- Prevents overexposure

### Layer 5: Account Balance
- Margin requirements checked
- No trades if insufficient funds

### Combined Protection
```
‚Ç¨20,000 account:
- Max 20 positions
- Each: 1% risk = ‚Ç¨200
- NO duplicate currency exposure
- Each currency appears max 1x

Worst case:
- 20 different currency pairs
- Each with unique currencies
- Total at risk: ‚Ç¨4,000 (20%)
- Diversified risk ‚úÖ
```

## Testing

### Test 1: Signal Filtering
```bash
# Run a single cycle (signals only)
python -c "
from ig_concurrent_worker import IGConcurrentWorker

worker = IGConcurrentWorker(
    auto_trading=False,  # Signals only
    max_workers=1,
    interval_seconds=60
)

worker.run_analysis_cycle()
"
```

Expected output:
- Analyzes 22 pairs
- Shows filtering step
- Lists selected signals
- No trades executed (auto-trading=False)

### Test 2: With Auto-Trading
```bash
# Start dashboard
streamlit run ig_trading_dashboard.py

# Enable auto-trading
# Watch terminal for filtering output
```

Expected behavior:
- Generates multiple signals
- Filters for currency exposure
- Executes only filtered signals
- Shows "Signals filtered: X"
