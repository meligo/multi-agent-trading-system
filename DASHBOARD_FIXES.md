# Streamlit Dashboard Fixes - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✅

## Date: 2025-10-30

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Market Hours Not Checked When Starting
**Problem:** User could start the trading engine even when forex market was closed (weekends), leading to wasted resources and confusion.

**Solution:** Added market hours validation to the `start_worker()` function:
- Checks if market is open before starting
- Shows clear error message if market is closed
- Displays next market open time and countdown
- Prevents system from running during closed hours

### Issue 2: Session State Lost on Browser Refresh
**Problem:** When closing and reopening the browser, the dashboard would lose connection to the running worker thread, making it appear as if the system was stopped when it was actually still running.

**Solution:** Implemented global worker singleton pattern:
- Worker stored in global variable (persists beyond browser session)
- Dashboard reconnects to existing worker on page load
- Worker survives browser refresh, tab close, and page reload
- Clear status indication when reconnecting to existing worker

## 📝 Implementation Details

### Changes Made to `ig_trading_dashboard.py`:

#### 1. Added Market Hours Import (line 23)
```python
from forex_market_hours import get_market_hours
```

#### 2. Added Global Worker Singleton (lines 33-47)
```python
# Global worker singleton (persists across browser refreshes)
_global_worker = None
_global_worker_lock = threading.Lock()

def get_global_worker():
    """Get the global worker instance (persists across sessions)."""
    global _global_worker
    with _global_worker_lock:
        return _global_worker

def set_global_worker(worker):
    """Set the global worker instance."""
    global _global_worker
    with _global_worker_lock:
        _global_worker = worker
```

#### 3. Updated Session State Initialization (lines 50-60)
```python
if 'worker' not in st.session_state:
    # Try to reconnect to existing worker
    existing_worker = get_global_worker()
    if existing_worker and existing_worker.running:
        st.session_state.worker = existing_worker
        st.session_state.worker_started = True
        st.session_state.auto_trading_enabled = existing_worker.auto_trading
    else:
        st.session_state.worker = None
        st.session_state.worker_started = False
        st.session_state.auto_trading_enabled = False
```

#### 4. Enhanced `start_worker()` with Market Hours Check (lines 69-117)
```python
def start_worker(auto_trading: bool = False):
    """Start the IG trading worker in background."""
    # Check if market is open
    market_hours = get_market_hours()
    market_status = market_hours.get_market_status()

    if not market_status['is_open']:
        # Market is closed - show warning to user
        next_open = market_status['next_open'].strftime('%A, %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z')
        time_until = market_status['time_until_open_human']
        st.error(f"""
        🛑 **FOREX MARKET IS CLOSED**

        Cannot start trading system while market is closed.

        **Next Market Open:** {next_open}
        **Time Until Open:** {time_until}

        The system will automatically pause during closed market hours.
        """)
        return False

    # ... create and start worker ...

    # Store in global singleton for persistence
    set_global_worker(st.session_state.worker)

    # Show market session info
    session = market_hours.get_market_session()
    st.success(f"""
    ✅ **System Started**

    **Market Session:** {session}
    **Auto-Trading:** {'ENABLED ⚠️' if auto_trading else 'DISABLED ✓'}
    **Analysis Interval:** {ForexConfig.ANALYSIS_INTERVAL_SECONDS // 60} minutes

    System will automatically pause when market closes (Friday 5 PM EST).
    """)
    return True
```

#### 5. Updated `stop_worker()` to Clear Singleton (lines 120-130)
```python
def stop_worker():
    """Stop the IG trading worker."""
    if st.session_state.worker and st.session_state.worker.running:
        st.session_state.worker.stop()
        st.session_state.worker_started = False

        # Clear global singleton
        set_global_worker(None)

        return True
    return False
```

#### 6. Added Market Hours Display to Sidebar (lines 403-421)
```python
# Market Hours Info
st.markdown("### 🕐 Market Hours")
market_hours = get_market_hours()
market_status = market_hours.get_market_status()

if market_status['is_open']:
    session = market_hours.get_market_session()
    st.success(f"**OPEN** ({session})")
    next_close = market_status['next_close'].strftime('%a %H:%M %Z')
    time_until = market_status['time_until_close_human']
    st.caption(f"Closes: {next_close}")
    st.caption(f"In: {time_until}")
else:
    st.error("**CLOSED**")
    next_open = market_status['next_open'].strftime('%a %H:%M %Z')
    time_until = market_status['time_until_open_human']
    st.caption(f"Opens: {next_open}")
    st.caption(f"In: {time_until}")
```

## 🎬 User Experience

### Before Fixes:

**Market Hours Issue:**
- User could start system on Saturday/Sunday
- System would run but do nothing (market closed)
- Wasted resources, confusing behavior
- No indication that market was closed

**Session Persistence Issue:**
- Start system → Close browser → Reopen
- Dashboard shows "STOPPED" even though worker is running
- Confusing state mismatch
- Need to restart system manually

### After Fixes:

**Market Hours Fixed:**
```
User clicks "START" on Saturday:

🛑 FOREX MARKET IS CLOSED

Cannot start trading system while market is closed.

Next Market Open: Sunday, 2025-11-03 17:00:00 EDT
Time Until Open: 1d 4h 23m

The system will automatically pause during closed market hours.
```

**Session Persistence Fixed:**
```
1. Start system on Thursday
2. Close browser completely
3. Reopen browser and go to dashboard
4. Dashboard automatically shows:
   🟢 SYSTEM ACTIVE - SIGNALS ONLY MODE
   (Reconnected to running worker)
```

---

## 📊 Dashboard UI Enhancements

### Sidebar Now Shows:

```
🕐 Market Hours
OPEN (OVERLAP)
Closes: Fri 17:00 EDT
In: 1d 8h 42m

---

System Info
Active Pairs: 14 pairs
Scan Interval: 5 minutes
Last Update: 08:21:45
```

### Start Button Behavior:

**When Market is OPEN:**
```
✅ System Started

Market Session: OVERLAP
Auto-Trading: DISABLED ✓
Analysis Interval: 5 minutes

System will automatically pause when market closes (Friday 5 PM EST).
```

**When Market is CLOSED:**
```
🛑 FOREX MARKET IS CLOSED

Cannot start trading system while market is closed.

Next Market Open: Sunday, 2025-11-03 17:00:00 EDT
Time Until Open: 1d 4h 23m

The system will automatically pause during closed market hours.
```

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Global Worker Singleton Pattern:

```python
# Module-level global (survives across Streamlit sessions)
_global_worker = None
_global_worker_lock = threading.Lock()

# Session state (per-browser-tab)
st.session_state.worker → Points to global worker

# Flow:
1. User starts system → Worker created → Stored globally
2. User closes browser → Session state cleared → Global worker remains
3. User reopens browser → New session created → Reconnects to global worker
4. User clicks stop → Worker stopped → Global worker cleared
```

### Thread Safety:
- Global worker access protected by threading.Lock()
- Prevents race conditions if multiple tabs open simultaneously
- Safe for concurrent access from multiple browser sessions

---

## ✅ Verification

### Test Market Hours Check:
```bash
# Set system time to Saturday
# Try starting dashboard
# Expected: Error message, cannot start

# Set system time to Thursday
# Try starting dashboard
# Expected: Success, shows OVERLAP session
```

### Test Session Persistence:
```bash
1. streamlit run ig_trading_dashboard.py
2. Click "START SYSTEM"
3. Wait for "🟢 SYSTEM ACTIVE"
4. Close browser completely
5. Reopen browser to http://localhost:8501
6. Expected: Dashboard shows "🟢 SYSTEM ACTIVE" immediately
```
